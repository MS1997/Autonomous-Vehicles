# Autonomous-Vehicles

Autonomous vehicles recognise traffic signals and signposts on the streets using a field of artificial intelligence known as computer vision (CV). After these images are recognised and collected using CV, we use machine learning algorithms to distinguish images from each other.

The aim is to train Machine Learning models which can distinguish and recognise the different road-sign pictures collected by the camera of a self-driving car. The Models used are: Random Forest, Decission Tree and KNN classification model. K-fold cross validation and train-test split is used to test the accuracy and precision of the said models.
